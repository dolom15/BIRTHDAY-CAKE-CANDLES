# BIRTHDAY-CAKE-CANDLES
The highest candles on a birthday cake are identified by this program, which also calculates how many of them share that maximum height. The birthdayCakeCandles function provides the result after using Max() to determine the tallest candle and Count() to get the number of candles that are that height.
